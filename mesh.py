"""Nonuniform 1D mesh generator, shared by the diode and the MOS capacitor.

Both devices are built the same way: one or two semiconductor "regions"
(diode: p-side + n-side; MOS: just the substrate) meeting a hard interface
(the junction, or the oxide/substrate boundary) at x=0, each region meshed
outward from that interface with `_region_nodes` below. That function picks
the mesh spacing to resolve two effects that can each demand a fine mesh
independently of the other:

  1. Proximity to the interface itself, where the electrostatic potential
     bends sharply (depletion physics) even when the local doping is
     perfectly flat - the classic reason this project's meshes have always
     been finest at x=0 and geometrically coarsen away from it.
  2. The local doping PROFILE changing quickly (relevant once doping.type is
     "linear" or "gaussian" rather than "flat") - resolved via a
     |d(ln N)/dx| based limit, wherever it happens to fall in the region.

For a flat profile, effect (2) is inactive everywhere, and `_region_nodes`
reduces exactly to the original geometric-growth algorithm (bit-for-bit) -
so nothing about the existing flat-doping diode/MOS results changes.
