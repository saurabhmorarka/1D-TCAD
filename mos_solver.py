"""MOS capacitor equilibrium solve and C-V sweep.

Unlike the diode, a MOS capacitor has no current path at all in steady
state (the gate is an ideal insulator) - so at every DC gate voltage the
whole structure sits at a single, uniform Fermi level (phin=phip=0
throughout, same convention as the diode's equilibrium solve), *provided*
enough time has passed for generation-recombination to fully populate any
inversion layer. That assumption is exactly the "quasi-static" or
"low-frequency" C-V measurement: no continuity equations, no G-R kinetics,
and no AC/small-signal analysis are needed for it - just a sequence of
equilibrium nonlinear-Poisson solves (physics.solve_poisson, reused as-is
with an oxide/semiconductor eps(x) and ni(x) profile), one per gate
voltage, differentiated numerically: C(V_G) = dQ_s/dV_G.

The high-frequency C-V curve, where minority (inversion) carriers can't
follow a fast small-signal probe, is a genuine "quasi-small-signal"
calculation: take the low-frequency solution's minority-carrier density at
a given DC gate bias, freeze it (via physics.solve_poisson's n_frozen/
p_frozen), perturb the gate voltage by a small delta, and let only the
majority carrier and potential respond. See the module docstring exchange
in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md for the reasoning behind not needing a literal
frequency-domain AC solve for either curve.
